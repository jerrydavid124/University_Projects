A collection of projects that I have done in University

GOMOKU:  basic recreation of Gomoku in Java, Uses Client and Server threads to communicate the game between two Users 
To run this go to the src directory then run Server.java and give it a port number 
Then Open run two Client.java files and give them the same port number you gave the server, they each also have a username option 
From there the two clients send moves back and forth between eachother.
Code Documentation is in the files. 


BITMAP: A bitmap editor created in C. Uses the bit data from these files and allows for edits in the images. Also gives back information about its header, color table and pixel data
You can change the RGB values of the image, as well as having the option to reverse the colors of the image.
It works with 8bpp and 24bpp files. 
Usage: ./bmp.c -h 
This will give you information about hte code 
Usage: ./bmp.c [-o file] [-i] [-d] [-R] [-r N] [-g N] [-b N] FILE
This is the general usage info on the file
Also you need to add the apue.3e files. These files allow for error checking. 
You can find these files here http://www.apuebook.com/code3e.html
